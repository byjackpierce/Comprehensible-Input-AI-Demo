# Comprehensible Input AI Demo

An interactive web application that demonstrates the principles of comprehensible input in language learning through AI-powered word guessing games.

## About Me & Project Goals

I'm learning software development (back end) and LLM integration through this project. I already have basic Python skills (mainly Jupyter notebooks and data work), I'm using this project to explore:
- LLM development and API integration
- Web application development with Flask
- Modern web development practices

## How It Works

The demo creates an interactive experience where users:

1. **Select a language** (German, Spanish, or English)
2. **Choose from AI-generated unfamiliar words** (currently nouns)
3. **Guess meanings** through context clues in AI-generated sentences
4. **Receive AI feedback** and scoring until they reach 9.5/10 accuracy
5. **Get a final summary** of their learning journey

The core concept demonstrates how learners can infer word meanings from context - the fundamental principle of comprehensible input in language acquisition.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI ChatGPT API
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (AI-assisted development)
- **Session Management**: Stateless, resets on page refresh
- **API Key Management**: Environment variables (TBD)

## Project Status

Currently in development. Focus areas:
- [ ] Basic Flask application setup
- [ ] OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Word generation and selection interface
- [ ] Sentence generation with target words
- [ ] User input and AI scoring system
- [ ] Modern, minimal UI design
- [ ] Deployment setup
