# Comprehensible Input AI Demo

A language learning game that teaches foreign words through progressive context clues.

## How it works
1. Select a language (German, Spanish, English)
2. Choose from AI-generated unfamiliar words
3. Guess meanings from context sentences
4. Get AI feedback until you understand

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask + OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **AI**: GPT-4o for word/sentence generation

## Development
This project includes a [learning tracker](./llm-learning-tracker/) that documents my systematic approach to developing LLM development skills.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python run.py
```
