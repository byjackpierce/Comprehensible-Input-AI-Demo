## Project Tracking Structure

Each project should have its own tracking file that documents:
- How each skill was used in the project
- What was learned about each skill
- Plans for deeper integration in future iterations
- Challenges encountered and solutions found

## Learning Approach

**Non-linear skill development:** Focus on projects first, then weave in skills as needed. Each project should touch multiple skills at different levels of depth.
