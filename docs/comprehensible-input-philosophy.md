# Comprehensible Input Philosophy

## Core Learning Principles

### Contextual Learning Approach
- **Multiple contexts per word** - Show different situations where words are used
- **Real-world usage** - Focus on practical, everyday contexts
- **Meaning over translation** - Help users understand concepts, not just memorize

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Focus: Nouns (MVP)
- **One-to-one mapping** - Simple, clear translations
- **Binary feedback** - Correct/incorrect, no scoring complexity
- **5 sentences max** - Different contexts, not progressive difficulty
- **Clean user flow** - Get the core experience working perfectly

### Future Considerations: Verbs & Adjectives
- **Multiple correct answers** - Accept synonyms (run/jog for correr)
- **Context-dependent meanings** - Same word, different uses
- **Partial credit system** - For close but not exact answers
- **Complex scoring logic** - When simple binary isn't enough
