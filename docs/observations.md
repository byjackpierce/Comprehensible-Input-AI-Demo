Seen an example where the sentences generated are similar. Can perhaps counter this by showing previously generated sentences for subsequent sentence generation and specically asking for more variation.
The word "parapluie" means "coat, umbrella". - this output is incorrect, you get this when you give 2 answers at once and one of them is right.
The feedback when the user gets the answer right should include all their guesses and a natural explanation of the word.
maybe we shouldnt just give them the anser after 5 guess but instead give them a hint, this helps them keep engaged.
