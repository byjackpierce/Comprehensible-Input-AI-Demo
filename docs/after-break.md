# After Break - Next Steps

## Priority Tasks When Returning

### 1. Improve Scoring System
- **Issue**: Inconsistent scoring between tests (same guesses getting different scores)
- **Issue**: Feedback sometimes gives too obvious hints
- **Action**: Refine scoring prompt for better consistency and appropriate hint levels
- **Action**: Test scoring system more thoroughly with edge cases

### 2. Complete User Flow
- **Current**: Basic word generation and single sentence/guess per word
- **Goal**: Multiple sentences per word for better context
- **Goal**: Multiple guesses per word with progressive feedback
- **Goal**: Complete end-to-end user experience flow

### 3. Testing & Robustness
- **Action**: More comprehensive testing of all AI components
- **Action**: Edge case handling and error recovery
- **Action**: Performance optimization if needed

## Notes
- Scoring system now properly handles English translations (9-10/10)
- Sentence generation works well across multiple languages
- Need to focus on user experience and flow completion
