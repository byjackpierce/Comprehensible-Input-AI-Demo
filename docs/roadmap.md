  ```

## Phase 2: Basic Flask Application

### 2.1 Flask App Foundation

- [x] Create basic OpenAI client setup
- [x] Test API connectivity

### 3.2 Word Generation
- [x] Implement function to generate 4 random nouns in target language
- [x] Create prompt engineering for word generation
- [x] Handle API responses and error cases
- [x] Test word generation for all three languages

### 3.3 Sentence Generation
- [x] Implement function to generate sentences with target word

- [x] Test sentence generation quality

### 3.4 Prompt Engineering & Testing
- [x] Create centralized prompt management system
- [x] Implement temperature testing framework
- [x] Test and optimize word generation prompts
- [x] Create testing documentation and results

## Phase 4: Core Game Logic

### 4.1 User Interaction Flow
- [x] Create language selection interface
- [x] Implement word selection from generated list
- [x] Add "refresh" functionality for new words
- [x] Handle user word choices

### 4.2 Guessing System
- [x] Create user input interface for guesses
- [x] ~~Implement AI scoring system (0-10 scale)~~ **ARCHIVED** - Scoring system moved to archive/scoring-system branch
- [x] ~~Create feedback generation based on scores~~ **ARCHIVED** - Scoring system moved to archive/scoring-system branch
- [ ] Implement binary feedback system (correct/incorrect)
- [ ] Add logic to continue until correct guess or 5 sentences

### 4.3 Session Management
- [ ] Implement session-based game state
- [ ] Track current word, sentences, and guesses
- [ ] Handle game reset functionality
- [ ] Ensure stateless design (no database needed)

### 4.4 Game Flow Completion
- [ ] Implement progressive sentence generation (multiple attempts)
- [ ] Add final summary generation when game is complete
- [ ] Create game completion flow
- [ ] Add restart/new word functionality

## Phase 5: Frontend Development

### 5.1 Interactive UI Components
- [x] Design language selection dropdown
- [x] Create word selection interface
- [x] Build sentence display component
- [x] Implement guess input form

### 5.2 User Experience
- [x] Add loading states for AI responses
- [x] Implement smooth transitions between game states
- [x] Create responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [x] Add visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses

### 5.3 Modern Styling
- [x] Implement Substack-inspired minimal design
- [x] Add typography and spacing
- [x] Create consistent color scheme
- [x] Ensure accessibility standards

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### 6.1 AI Feedback Enhancement
- [ ] ~~Improve scoring accuracy~~ **ARCHIVED** - Scoring system moved to archive/scoring-system branch
- [ ] ~~Create more nuanced feedback messages~~ **ARCHIVED** - Scoring system moved to archive/scoring-system branch
